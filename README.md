The source code I developed is in "data-sourcing-challenge / M6_Starter_Code / M6_Starter_Code / retrieve_movie_data.ipynb".  This work first gets reviews from the New York Times. In turn, these title are looked up in the TMDB API first to use the NYT title to get the TMDB movie ID and in turn to use the movie ID to query the detailed results (15 fields).

The output in the form of a CSV is in "data-sourcing-challenge / M6_Starter_Code / M6_Starter_Code / output / collected_data.csv"  (note: the other CSV file there is the original that came with the starter code) 

Thanks!
